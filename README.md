# Kubernetes (K8)

Kubernetes is an orchestration tool used to cluster groups of hosts running Linux tonainers and manage these containers in terms of automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management. 

What can K8 do for you:
- Self heals
- Load balance and Service Discovery
- Automated rollouts and rollback
- Auto scaling
- Automatic bin packing
- Sotrage orchestration

**Adapt a micro service architecture: start small with 1 / 2 services with small teams test, learn and move own**

**Docker to containerise apps for fast and consistent delivery**

**Orchestration with K8 to make life easy**

### Why should we use it

Kubernetes should be used to group together a collection of containers (can be docker containers) and control resources allocating and manage cloud applications for these groups of containers. It should be used because it allows us to automate the steps of orchestration and dealing with containers.
